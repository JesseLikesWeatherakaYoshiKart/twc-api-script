    <p>My Name is Jesse, I live in Maryland in a wonderful military family of 5. I am actually pretty young (lol) but I have managed to create this script alone.
        I have lived in California, Texas, Georgia, and Maryland.
       I am not in Maryland becuase my parents got stationed here in case if you guys are wondering.
    I love meterology and coding. 
    I have been a weather enthusiast for 6 years (and counting).

    I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2aWyRtnRCg">this video</a> almost everyday when I was six years old thinking it would be today's forecast.
    </p>
    <p>On May 18, 2019 in the early morning hours, I would wake up to tornado sirens. At first, this frightened me, and I woke up everybody in the household thinking we we're all gonna die.</p>

    <p>My dad goes out on the back porch trying to see the tornado, but I begged him to go back inside and get to our safe spot.</p>

    <p>A user on YouTube archived KSAN's broadcast on the storm I witnessed and it can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7MxGTl48sg">Here.</a></p>

    <p>The tornado went right through the heart of the town but mainly causing minor damage.</p>

   <p>The storm actually formed a hook echo on the KSAN radar site.</p>

   <ul>The Same Storm that day on KSJT's radar site. Courtesty of <a href="https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/vtec/#2019-O-NEW-KSJT-TO-W-0030/SJT-N0Q-201905181012">Iowa State University's Warning Search.</a></ul>

   <p>Later on in my life, I would actually beign to think that storms we're actually really cool to witness! But I have rarely ever witnessed a storm like that ever since.</p>

   <p>But I was finally thrilled on July 29th 2023 when extreme heat fueled the storms forming that day. A PDS Severe Thunderstorm Warning was issued for my county. My first ever.</p>

   <p>NWS LWX: THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE STORM FOR WASHINGTON DC.
   </p>
   
   <p>HAZARD..80 mph wind gusts</p>

   <p>My nearest METAR reported an 84 mph wind gust, and I experienced it. One of the best storms of my life!</p>

   <p>I would learn more about HTML, JavaScript, Python, and CSS more in my life.</p>

   <p>To this day I am happily writing weather code.</p>
